# prov-it: Provenance Tools and Techniques for daily use

This repository contains code for tracking, maintaining and disseminating provenance information associated with our work. Here, our definition and application closely follows that of the W3C Provenance Working Group which says  "Provennance is information about entities, activities, and people involved in producing a piece of data or thing, which can be used to form assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness" (https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/, retrieved 2017-10-09). The code in this repository relies heavily on the ideas laid out by the Provenance Working Group in set of guidance documents collectively called the [PROV Family of Documents](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/).
